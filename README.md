Monitoring use of Xbox Series X devices on Xbox Live pre-launch.

So while working on a script to help monitor online populations of Halo titles on Xbox Live (for [SpartanFinder.com](https://spartanfinder.com)) I noticed my script returning players who were playing on devices labeled "Scarlett" instead of Xbox 360, Xbox One, or PC. My script uses the official xbox live services api (aka [XSAPI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/xbox-live/api-ref/xsapi/live-introduction-to-xbox-live-apis)) to crawl through gamertags and friendslist to see who's on and what game they are playing. This is public information but I believe using the XSAPI is the only way to identify what device is user is on.

So apparently some people have pre-lease Xbox Series X hardware and are using it to play on Xbox Live either for development, testing, or leisure. I have uploaded a json list file to this repo to let people see the raw results of users who's presence indicated they were online at some point via a "Scarlett" device. If you are interested in this and either have questions or insights please just open up an issue. Below is what I have gleaned so far.
